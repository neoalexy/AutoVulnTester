## Overview

AutoVulnTester automates the scanning of web applications by injecting test payloads to check for SQLi, XSS and Brute Force vulnerabilities. It integrates AI-based analysis to provide human-readable explanations and mitigation suggestions for each detected issue. The tool outputs structured JSON reports and can generate PDF summaries, enabling clear communication of security posture.

## Features

- **SQL Injection detection:** Tests for typical SQL injection payloads and error patterns.  
- **Cross-Site Scripting detection:** Injects XSS payloads and verifies their presence in responses.  
- **Brute Force attack simulation:** Attempts login brute force using supplied credentials and password lists.  
- **Vulnerability analysis:** Uses Hugging Face models to generate concise explanations and mitigation tips.  
- **Report generation:** Outputs JSON and PDF reports detailing findings with confidence levels and payload information.  
- **Slack notifications:** Optional alerting via Slack webhook on detected vulnerabilities.

## Core Components

- **Scanner:** Handles all vulnerability detection tests using HTTP requests and payload injection.  
- **Analyzer:** Interacts with AI models to generate vulnerability explanations and recommendations.  
- **Reporter:** Creates PDF reports from scan results with clear formatting.  
- **Notifier:** Sends alerts to Slack channels when vulnerabilities are detected.  
- **CLI Interface:** Command-line tool to perform scans, generate reports, and optionally send notifications.

## Samples

A sample PDF report generated by AutoVulnTester is included in the `samples/` directory.  
This example demonstrates the format and details you can expect from the scan reports including detected vulnerabilities, payloads, confidence levels, and generated explanations.
You can open the sample PDF to see how the tool summarizes and presents security findings for easy review and sharing.
